# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of core machine learning algorithms **from scratch**, created to revise mathematical foundations and strengthen conceptual understanding of how these algorithms work internally.

The project is **learning-focused**, prioritizing clarity and correctness over performance or production-level optimization.

---

## Algorithms Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

All algorithms are implemented using basic Python and NumPy, without using high-level machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`.

## Project Structure

The project consists of **five files**, including algorithm implementations on test datasets:

├── shiv-lr.py

├── shiv-log-reg.py

├── shiv-knn.py

├── random_forest.py

├── DecisionTree.py


- Each model file contains the implementation of the algorithm from scratch
