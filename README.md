# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of core machine learning algorithms **from scratch**, developed as part of **coursework** and **self-study** to revise mathematical foundations and strengthen conceptual understanding.

The project focuses on understanding **how algorithms work internally**, rather than using high-level machine learning libraries.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

All algorithms are implemented using basic Python and NumPy, without relying on libraries such as `scikit-learn`.
also **Decision boundary visualizations** for better geometric understanding

## Motivation

This project was created to support coursework and to **revise the mathematics and core concepts** behind machine learning algorithms.

While working through the subject, whenever gaps in understanding appeared—especially in mathematical derivations and algorithmic logic—additional learning resources were consulted before implementing the algorithms independently.

The main goals were to:
- strengthen understanding of underlying mathematics
- connect theory with implementation
- build confidence in explaining algorithms from first principles
